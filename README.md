It's a full-stack application that implements several features for a Traffic Laws test platform. The app will eventually display four views:

1. a **Main** of the two section admin and student
2. an **Admin** view for create the acount
3. a **Student** view for passing the test
4. an **result** view for the result of the test

### Before You Begin

**Complete these setup tasks**

- [ ] In your terminal, navigate to this assessment's `Driving school` directory and run `git remote rm origin` to prevent yourself from accidentally pushing your code.
- [ ] Run `npm install` inside the `Driving school` directory to install dependencies.
- [ ] Ensure that the MongoDB process is running on your computer (`mongod`).
- [ ] Serve your application from the provided Node/Express web server.
  - If using React, start your application with two commands, `npm run react-dev` and `npm run server-dev`, in two separate terminal tabs.

**user experience:**
- as an admin i expect to create an acount and manage my in formation saved in the database.
- as a student i expect when i input my information i start passing the test and see the result and my input info.
